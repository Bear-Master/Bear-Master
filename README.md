- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bear-Master
- 👀 I’m interested in fleshing out ideas, especially when it comes to providing accessibility to projects happening now.
- 🌱 I’m in the process of leaving / divorcing myself from the for-profit world & headed back to my not-for-profit roots 
      after a 20 year stint with Honeywell / Microsoft, the last 7+ years of which were spent working on accessibility 
      issues around the Windows 10 OS. Switching to 11 was a good time to leave!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that touches / brings together the above two ideas, no matter how strange or 
      far apart the connection may seem.
      
      I don't do code, I do thoughts and words.

- 📫  Reach me at altbear7@disroot.org - I will respond!
